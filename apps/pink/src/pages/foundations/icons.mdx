## General Icons

In Appwrite we use a subset of the [heroicons](https://v1.heroicons.com/) library. To use them, use the class name of the icon you want shown below.

<Icons />

## Additional Icons

Social and technology icons are available in gray-scale and color. Gray-scale Icons were translated into class names and color icons are available as SVG files.

<BrandIcons />

## Best Practice

We recommend using at minimum 4px of space between icons and labels for
legibility. Icons should be aligned to the center of a single line of text. If
there are multiple lines in a label, the icon should be aligned to the center
of the first line in the label.
