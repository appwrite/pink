Pink Design makes use of the [astro.build](https://astro.build/) library.

New pages can be added by creating a `.mdx` file in the `pages` folder.

To show code examples the `<Preview>...</Preview>` tag can be used. To render html without the code example `<Showcase>...</Showcase>` tag can be used. They are both auto-imported in every `.mdx` file inside the pages folder. The auto-import is handled in `/pages/_autoimports.ts` with [m2dx](https://astro-m2dx.netlify.app/docs)

`.m2dx` is also used to overwrite native markdown components to apply custom classes to HTML elements. This behavior can be modified in the `/pages/_components.ts`

Layout is applied in `/pages/_frontmatter.yaml`

There are four custom directives. `COMPARISON`, `DO`, `DONT`, and `IMG` they are set in `/pages/_directives.ts` and are used to display best practices across the documentation.

```md
::::COMPARISON

::IMG[/images/button-do-1.png, description]
:::DO
Increase recognition by using icons with universal meaning. Increase readability by keeping text short and using uppercase letter only for the first word.
:::

::IMG[/images/button-dont-1.png, description]
:::DONT
Avoid using specific icons, uppercase in every word and long sentences.

## Development

### Setup

After installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), run the following commands to setup Pink Design:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/appwrite/pink.git
cd pink
pnpm install
```

### Development

This command can be used to develop Pink Design components with an auto-reload preview exposed at [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333).

Both applications inherit styles and icons respectively from the ui and icon packages. Changes made to these packages will also affect the applications. Styles and icons are taken from the `dist/` folder so `pnpm run build` must be run to be able to see updates.

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

### Build

You can build Pink Design, including all dependencies in [`packages/`](packages/), with:

```sh
pnpm run build
```

## Submit a Pull Request 🚀

Branch naming convention is as follows

`TYPE-ISSUE_ID-DESCRIPTION`

example:

```
doc-548-submit-a-pull-request-section-to-contribution-guide
```

When `TYPE` can be:

- **feat** - is a new feature
- **doc** - documentation only changes
- **cicd** - changes related to CI/CD system
- **fix** - a bug fix
- **refactor** - code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

**All PRs must include a commit message with the description of the changes made!**

Start by forking the project and use the `git clone` command to download the repository to your computer. A standard procedure for working on an issue would be to:

1. Before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream to make sure your default branch is be up to date.

```
$ git pull
```

2. Create a new branch from the default branch. For example `doc-548-submit-a-pull-request-section-to-contribution-guide`

```
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

3. Work - commit - repeat ( be sure to be in your branch )
4. Push changes to GitHub

```
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

6. Submit your changes for review. If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.
7. Start a Pull Request (PR) by clicking on `Create pull request`. Make sure to update the PR description following the template provided.
8. Wait for a code review.
9. If you need to make changes based on feedback, make sure to re-request a review from your reviewer after you've made the necessary changes.

![Re-Request a Review](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-4714/images/help/pull_requests/request-re-review.png)

10. After approval, your PR will be merged.
11. You can delete your branch after it has been merged.

## Guidelines

### Performance

Page load times are a key consideration for users of all browsers and device types.

There are some general things we can do in front-end development to reduce load times:

- Minimise HTTP requests
- Minimise blocking – content should be readable before client side processing
- Lazy load 'supplementary' content (especially images)
- Leverage Astro and use as little JS as possible

### Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

If you repeat anything that has already been defined in code, refactor it so that it only ever has one representation in the codebase.

If you reuse code, you avoid the need to change the same code in multiple places in the future.

### Separation of concerns

Separate _structure_ from _presentation_ from _behaviour_ to aid maintainability and understanding.

- Keep CSS (presentation), HTML (structure), and JS (behaviour) in the same respective Astro component
- Don't choose HTML elements to imply style
- Where appropriate, use CSS rather than Javascript for animations and transitions
- Try to use templates when defining markup in Javascript

### Write code to be read

Follow the principles of ['Keep It Simple, Stupid'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) (KISS); hard to read or obfuscated code is difficult to maintain and debug. Don't be too clever; write code to be read.

### Dependencies

Please avoid introducing new dependencies to Pink Design without consulting the team. New dependencies can be very helpful but also introduce new security and privacy issues, complexity, and impact the total page size and load time.

Adding a new dependency should have vital value on the product with minimum possible risk.

## Introducing New Features

We would 💖 you to contribute to Pink Design, but we would also like to make sure Pink Design is as great as possible and loyal to its vision and mission statement 🙏.

For us to find the right balance, please open an issue explaining your ideas before introducing

This is important for Pink Design maintainers to discuss the feature's design and architecture to help the contribution fit in organically in the codebase. Some bigger features might need to go through our RFC process.

## Other Ways to Help

Pull requests are great, but there are many other areas where you can help Pink Design.

### Sending Feedbacks & Reporting Bugs

Sending feedback is a great way for us to understand your different use cases of Pink Design better. If you had any issues, bugs, or want to share about your experience, feel free to do so on our GitHub issues page or at our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/GSeTUeA).

### Submitting New Ideas

If you think Pink Design could use a new feature, please open an issue on our GitHub repository, stating as much information as you can think about your new idea and it's implications. We would also use this issue to gather more information, get more feedback from the community, and have a proper discussion about the new feature.

### Improving Documentation

Submitting documentation updates, enhancements, designs, or bug fixes. Spelling or grammar fixes will be very much appreciated.

## Code of Conduct

Help us keep Pink Design open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/appwrite/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
